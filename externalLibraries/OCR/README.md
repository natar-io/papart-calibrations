## TODO
Download as a processing library...

For now you can copy them in your Javacv library folder: `~/sketchbook/libraries/javacv/library/`.


## Set a language in Tesseract

Download the language there: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata 

Look at the **Language Data** part in their [compiling guide](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Compiling).
