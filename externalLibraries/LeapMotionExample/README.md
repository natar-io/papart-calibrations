# Leap Motion example

This demo shows integration with the [Leap Motion for Processing](https://github.com/nok/leap-motion-processing) library.
You need to install the drivers (and start the daemon on linux) and the
library.

It is a minimalistic example, you have to put your leap motion "inside" the grey box.
Then when you put your hand on top of the leap motion the fingertip and joints
will shop as small spheres.
